Radiance is a mechanic-heavy mod based around manipulating and utilizing the magical resource of the same name. A highlight of the mod is additional means of gathering various vanilla resources. 

A wiki does not exist for the mod, as the in-game information book is meant to suffice as proper documentation and guidance. You can access it from the top right of your inventory above your equipment button. An online version of the guidebook can be found at [LINK].
