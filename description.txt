Radiance is a mechanic-heavy mod inspired by Minecraft mods of magic nature. The mod is based around manipulating and utilizing the magical resource of the same name.

-Your primary method of generating Radiance (aforementioned magical resource) is by feeding Fallen Stars to cells, with the first that one you should create being the Poor Radiance Cell. 

-Pedestals, a tile in the mod, are essential to your workings as well, acting as a receptacle for cells that will let them function as normal and also be able to output Radiance.

-Rays are used to transfer Radiance between tiles, and are created at no extra material cost with a Radiance Control Rod. Every tile that can accept or distribute Radiance has glowing outputs (marked by red) and inputs (marked by blue).

-Transmutation, a strange process of converting items into other items, is the primary method of crafting with Radiance.

-Your guide for the mod is the Encycloradia. It is available to be opened at any time above your armor/accessories interface within your inventory, and it contains everything you should need to know to use the mod.
